        Once again,my name is DAVID OKEZE.
        <br />
        I hail from Delta State.
        <br />
        I was born and still currently residing in Jos,Plateau state.
        <br />
        I'm currently learning Frontend-Engineerint at ALTSCHOOLAFRICA
        <br />
        I've always loved the idea of me becoming a software engineer.Like for
        real it's a very cool job.
        <br />
        So, even as i admired it alot i still saw it to be something difficult
        and tricky to learn.But an amazing cousin of mine came across the school
        on the internet.
        <br />
        He made some researches on the school and knew it was perfect for me to
        start my software engineering career.And that's how i got here.
        <br />
        I'm confident that Altschool will impact alot in my life.So even if the
        journey is tough,it'll definitely be a successful one.
